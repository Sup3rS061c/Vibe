[Changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md)

## Install

1. Install **Java 8** and **Forge 1.8.9-11.15.1.2318**.
2. Copy the built `Vibe-1.8.9-<version>.jar` into your game directory's `mods/` folder.
3. Launch the Forge profile.

Use modules only where permitted by the server's rules. Vibe is client-only.

## Quick start

- **Right Shift** opens ClickGUI; choose Skeet, Futuristic, NeverLose, Augustus or Xanax.
- **H** opens the HUD editor. Both default keybinds can be changed.
- **`.help`** lists chat commands; **Tab** completes them.
- **Alt Manager** in the main menu or server list manages accounts.

See the [GTA7 guide](docs/GTA7.md) for the expanded map, controls, upgrades, skins and save backups.
See [Music and visual effects](docs/MUSIC_AND_EFFECTS.md) for Fog, Torus, radio,
the media HUD and audio-reactive waves. Fog and CustomCrosshair also work in GTA7.

## Build and run

Use **JDK 21** to build. The mod targets Java 8; launching Minecraft also requires
a Java 8 runtime.

On Windows, the launchers in the project root find JDK 21 automatically.
Run these commands from the project root, or double-click the scripts:

```powershell
.\build.bat
```

The installable JAR is written to `build/libs/Vibe-1.8.9-<version>.jar`.

`./gradlew verifyNeverLoseRendering` checks NeverLose controls and clipping in an
offscreen OpenGL context, writing screenshots to `build/neverlose-render-check/`.
`./gradlew verifyXanaxRendering` checks Xanax rendering, controls, profiles and
small-screen layouts, writing screenshots to `build/xanax-render-check/`.
`./gradlew verifyChamsRendering` checks Chams materials, transparency, partial
cover, armor/skin toggles and OpenGL state, with a preview in `build/chams-render-check/`.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `.\run.bat` | Build and launch with OptiFine; keep data in `run/client/`. |
| `.\run-fresh.bat` | Launch with a new profile in `run/first-start/session-*/`. |

With `JAVA_HOME` set to JDK 21, use `./gradlew build` on Linux/macOS or
`.\gradlew.bat build` on Windows. The first build or launch downloads dependencies.

## Project layout

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `src/main/java/` | Java source code. |
| `src/main/resources/` | Mod metadata and bundled resources. |
| `src/main/resources/assets/vibe/` | Vibe assets, including cosmetics, Girlfriend sounds, menu shaders and Waifu presets. |
| `src/main/resources/assets/minecraft/` | Assets loaded through the Minecraft resource namespace. |
| `src/test/` | Tests and test resources. |
| `tools/` | Helper scripts and additional Gradle tasks. |
| `docs/` | Changelog and feature guides. |
| `LICENSES/` | License texts and attribution. |
| `gradle/` | Gradle wrapper files. |
| `build/`, `.gradle/`, `run/` | Generated build output, local caches and game data; ignored by Git. |

The root contains the Windows launchers (`build.bat`, `run.bat`, `run-fresh.bat`),
the README, Git ignore rules and standard Gradle build configuration
and launchers (`build.gradle`, `settings.gradle`, `gradle.properties`, `gradlew`, `gradlew.bat`).

Add bundled assets beneath `src/main/resources/assets/vibe/`. Gradle packages them
automatically and generates preset lists for `shader/`, `waifu/` and the MP3 event
folders in `girlfriend/`. The Cosmetica download helper writes to `cosmetica/` here too.

## License and credits

Vibe combines code under [GPLv3](LICENSES/GPL-3.0.txt) with Schizoid-derived Fog, Torus and
media HUD components under AGPLv3. The [license and attribution guide](LICENSES/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md)
explains the component terms, source-distribution duties and open release issues.
License texts and provenance are collected in `LICENSES/`; known gaps are listed
directly in the guide. `build` checks local license-document links and preserves
bundled libraries' embedded notices separately, with an inventory of the resolved
JARs under `META-INF/vibe/dependencies/INDEX.md`.

Open **Licenses & credits** in the main menu or pause menu to read the credits
and license texts offline. `.source` identifies the matching source archive;
distribute the build's `-sources.zip` alongside the JAR.
